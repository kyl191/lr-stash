Requirements
---
Lightroom 3+ (Tested on 3.6 and 4.0Beta)
a deviantArt account

Installation Instructions
---
0. Extract all the files in the ZIP file into a folder named lr-stash.lrplugin. 
This should have been done automatically, but just in case.
1. In the Lightroom Plug-In Manager (File > Plug-in Manager), click the "Add" button on the bottom left, and find the lr-stash.lrplugin folder.
2. Click "Select Folder".
3. The plugin should now show up in Lightroom as "Sta.sh" with the status "Installed and running".

Using the Plugin
---
In the Export panel, select “Export To: Sta.sh”. That means, click on the dropdown menu at the top of the export panel, and select “Sta.sh” from the list.

The first time you use the plugin, you’ll have to authorize the plugin. This sounds harder than it is:

1.  Click the “Log In” button.
2.  Click the “Authorize at Sta.sh” button that pops up.
3.  Click the shiny blue “Authorize” button in the web browser window that pops up.
4.  Wait for dA to work for a bit.
5.  Copy the numbers on the “Your code is:” page.
6.  You sure you copied the numbers, and only the numbers?
7.  Paste the numbers into the convenient text box that Lightroom is now showing.
8.  Click “OK”
9.  Wait for Lightroom to go get your username.

If everything works as expected, you'll then be able to submit photos to Sta.sh. You'll have to visit Sta.sh (https://sta.sh) to submit your photos to your dA gallery. However, this is a restriction on deviantArt's side - they do not allow direct submission to your galleries at the moment.
