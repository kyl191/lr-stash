LR-Sta.sh
Lightroom Integration with Sta.sh

v 0.2
+ Ha! Icon's working now.
+ Apparently, export settings are handled automagically by Lightroom, so that's all good now.
- Still might have problems with the publish support
 - Managed to work Sta.sh into an inconsistent state - API doesn't reflect stuff that's deleted on the site
- Thinking about it, I'm still worried about handling errors from the JSON response when you upload an image
 - I just display them right now, no error handling whatsoever.

v 0.1
+ You know what? I got tired of the points. So, yeah, 0.1 now, thank you very much.
+ Seems to be working for publishing + exporting
- Still no icon though
- Also, no saving the export settings, because I don't know what the export settings for stuff like filesize are.

v 0.0.0.5
+ Support for Publishing to Sta.sh
- No cute icon though

v 0.0.0.4
+ Added a file size check before uploading, just to ensure that there's enough space in Sta.sh
+ Remaining space is also displayed in the Export dialog for the user's info

v 0.0.0.3
+ Fixed the tag problems
 -> Anything that's not an alphanumeric character will be stripped. No exceptions.
+ Most network communication is done with an improved method that *should* handle errors

v 0.0.0.2
- Uploading additions
+ Title Support
+ Caption (Description) Support (mapped to Artist's Comments)

v 0.0.0.1
- Initial release

+ Uploading works
+ Authentication works
+ It's something shiny to click on
- Dialog boxes all over the place from debug code
- No (minimal) network error handling
- Tags that are more than one word break when uploaded (Tags following the broken tag aren't processed)
 -> THIS IS A LIMITATION OF STA.SH
 -> However, I can strip the invalid tags out. Hopefully.

o Plugin id & plugin secret are littered everywhere in plain text
 -> However, even compiled, you can still look for something that looks like a URL and get the codes that way, so, eh. Please don't abuse it?
