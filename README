LR-Sta.sh
Lightroom Integration with Sta.sh

v 0.0.0.3
+ Fixed the tag problems
 -> Anything that's not an alphanumeric character will be stripped. No exceptions.
+ Most network communication is done with an improved method that *should* handle errors

v 0.0.0.2
- Uploading additions
+ Title Support
+ Caption (Description) Support (mapped to Artist's Comments)

v 0.0.0.1
- Initial release

+ Uploading works
+ Authentication works
+ It's something shiny to click on
- Dialog boxes all over the place from debug code
- No (minimal) network error handling
- Tags that are more than one word break when uploaded (Tags following the broken tag aren't processed)
 -> THIS IS A LIMITATION OF STA.SH
 -> However, I can strip the invalid tags out. Hopefully.

o Plugin id & plugin secret are littered everywhere in plain text
 -> However, even compiled, you can still look for something that looks like a URL and get the codes that way, so, eh. Please don't abuse it?
